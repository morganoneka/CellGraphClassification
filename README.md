# Cell Graph Classification

The goal of this code is to take cell-pair interaction graphs, output by [Giotto](https://rubd.github.io/Giotto_site/index.html)'s cell pair enrichment functionality, and classify into diagnostic groups based on these graphs.

The Giotto output is in the two output folders. The original data isn't available and isn't mine to share, however the provided `.R` files show a bit about how I prepared the data for this analysis. For more information about how to run Giotto, see my [Spatial Pipeline](https://github.com/morganoneka/SpatialPipeline) repository.

The two `ipynb` files are notebooks using two different methods of graph classification to classify graphs into diagnostic groups.
